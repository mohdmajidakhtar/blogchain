A family came to my dream yesterday night, twitched me from my sense,

slowly the moment became dense, their eyes was to offer some suspense,

I observed them with my barely unfurl eyes,

one of them had sleepless nights, other had sense of emptied appetite.

The smallest one of them reached to me worldly ears, 

and spoke the uncanny words that unsettled my heart with shears.

He said and I quote,

"As the IT-Guy, you deal with cutting-edge technology all day; can you give solution to my cutting feet’s?

You deploy programs to the cloud, can you drop us somewhere too amidst the cloud? 

You talk about speed and latency; do we fit in your benchmarks as a critical parameter?

Efficiency, yeah right, how much is the efficiency of our perseverance?

You have high bandwidth internet at your home, can you allocate a minimalist bandwidth for our transfer across a given path.

You always keep check of LOC (Line of Code), and we are been kept in the LOC (Line of Covid).

You get furious when your CPU is overheating, ever wondered what the temperature out there is?

You have webcam for all your online meeting, but where is it when we are getting the beating?

I have food in front of me lying on the road, but with that hidden camera, I am scared of my inadequacy blowed.

I heard you know Photoshop; can you remove my tears and bring a smile on my face?

No other drive but Recycle Bin is our place. 

You have again started *‘khushiyon ki home delivery’*; can you deliver us to our homes?

We tried to reboot the system, but didn’t have the administrative rights,

atleast running on safe mode rebound, we got the fatal error `.exe (No humanity found)`.

You are so vulnerable of your smartphone’s battery, wish I was too made of Lithium-ion,

since charging is a better state to be than dyin'.

You keep your machines in air conditioners, do you know the condition of air outside?

Keep finding the *‘Big Oh’* for your lifeless algorithms, when you couldn’t hear our *‘Big Ahh!’*.

You are thinking of festive, we are on the brink of survival.

Perform normalization in your structured databases, but can you normalize our life again?

You get annoyed filling the google sheet form, we have accepted *'heardless pain is the new norm'*.

You are fasting till the dusk, we are filling stomach with *ashk*.

Just do a ping test to your heart, are you even connected to humanity as a whole?"

**'The men came to my dream were the labourers' - the wandering souls.**
